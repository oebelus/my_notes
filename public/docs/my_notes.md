Welcome to my personal notes site, inspired by the simplicity and functionality of Obsidian. I plan to share more notes since I have countless ones LOL, so keep visiting to track updates!

This site is designed to feel like an Obsidian vault. It's still under development, and I plan to implement other features including Tags and Search.
