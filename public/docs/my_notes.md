Welcome to my personal notes site, inspired by the simplicity and functionality of Obsidian. I plan to share more notes since I have countless ones LOL, so keep visiting to track updates!

#### Overview

This site is a digital knowledge base where I capture resources, and ideas. Notes are organized by topic.

#### How to Use This Site

This site is designed to feel like an Obsidian vault. It's still under development, and I plan to implement other features including:

- **Internal Links**: Just like in Obsidian, you’ll find links between notes for connected topics. Click on these to jump from one note to another.

- **Backlinks**: At the bottom of each note, you’ll see “Related Notes,” showing connections to other pages. Use these to explore the context and related ideas.

- **Tags**: Notes are tagged for quick filtering by themes or projects. Click on a tag to see all notes in that category.

- **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific topics, keywords, or tags across all notes.
