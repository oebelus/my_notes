\- Smart contracts are computer programs in a block. Users can trigger the existing code pieces (“smart contracts”) on a blockchain to execute them with the inputs they want.

\- Smart contracts are self-executing programs deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that run based on predefined rules. They allow DApps to automate processes and enforce rules without the need for intermediaries. When a user interacts with a smart contract, the blockchain automatically executes the contract’s code.

\- Every smart contract is associated with an account. Users also have accounts. When a user wants to trigger (“call”) a smart contract, that user creates a transaction to the smart contract account. - Triggering a smart contract is the same as creating a new transaction to the account of that smart contract.

👉 Miners use their computational resources—mostly time and memory—to execute smart contracts. Transaction fees help with two things:

1- **Incentivizing miners**. It helps to ensure that a blockchain remains decentralized by incentivizing miners to get paid and participate in the network.

- 🪙 The Bitcoin network incentivizes miners by letting them create new bitcoins and transfer them to their own accounts.

2. **Preventing spam and abuse.** Requiring a fee to run the code deters spam accounts from sending too many transactions to the network.

> **Fun fact**: The transaction fee is called different things for different blockchains. Ethereum and Cosmos use the label of “gas fee” while Solana calls it “rent.”

So, when smart contracts are executed:

1- **Generating new transactions to be added to new blocks.** 2. **Updating the state of the blockchain**

Smart contracts can include logic like transferring tokens, updating balances, or providing decentralized services.
