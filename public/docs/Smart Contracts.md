#### Overview

Smart contracts are self-executing programs on the blockchain (notably on Ethereum) that operate based on predefined rules.

When users interact with a smart contract, it automatically runs according to its code, allowing for automation in decentralized applications (DApps) without intermediaries.

#### Accounts and Transactions

Each smart contract and user has an associated account. When a user wants to trigger (‚Äúcall‚Äù) a smart contract, they create a transaction directed to the contract‚Äôs account.

- This interaction initiates the smart contract's execution.

#### Miners and Transaction Fees

Miners use their computational resources‚Äîmostly time and memory‚Äîto execute smart contracts. Transaction fees serve two key purposes:

1- **Incentivizing miners**: Fees help maintain a decentralized network by rewarding miners, who ensure security and consensus.

- The Bitcoin ü™ô network incentivizes miners by letting them create new bitcoins (minting) and transfer them to their own accounts.
2- **Preventing spam and abuse**: Requiring fees to execute code helps deter spam transactions, reducing abuse of the network.

> **Fun Fact**: Different blockchains have unique terms for transaction fees. For example, Ethereum and Cosmos use ‚Äúgas fees,‚Äù while Solana calls it ‚Äúrent.‚Äù

#### Smart Contract Execution Process

So, when smart contracts are executed:

1. **Generating new transactions**: Contract executions create new transactions that get added to the blockchain.
2. **Updating the state of the blockchain**: updating balances, transferring tokens, or executing other predefined actions.

#### Composability in Blockchain Development

A core feature of blockchain is **composability**‚Äîthe permissionless and seamless interaction between contracts. This is vital in decentralized finance (DeFi), where complex financial products interact smoothly using shared contract interfaces.
